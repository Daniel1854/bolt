# Bolt: Lighting fast file/folder launcher for Unix

# How it works

- **generate-list** script gets all of your preferred file paths at startup from your whitelist config and it filters out the blacklist matches

- **search** script shows you a dmenu prompt to pick a file

- **launch** script launches the file according to it's type

- **watch-list** monitors changes in your whitelist directories and updates your search list accordingly

# Documentation

Coming soon! lol.
